    <h1>Best Places to Visit in Dakshina Kannada Mangaluru</h1>
    
        <h2>Dharmasthala</h2>
        <p>This well-known pilgrimage place, located 75 kilometres east of Mangaluru and nestled in sylvan environs on the lower slopes of the Western Ghats, is an unusual fusion of faiths. The Manjunatha Temple is a famous Shaivaite centre with Madhwa Vaishnavaite priests and is run by the Heggades, a hereditary Jain family. The Jain influence may be observed in the 39-foot-tall statue of Bahubali, which was constructed on a hill near the temple in 1980. The Manjusha Museum, located directly across from the temple, exhibits a diverse collection of items, including ancient inscriptions on palm leaves, silver jewellery, and religious statues. Charity is a part of life here, and pilgrims who visit the temple are offered free food. One million lamps are burned during the yearly festival, Laksha Deepotsava, which takes place in November-December, when literary and religious discussions are conducted.</p>

        <h2>Kukke Subrahmanya</h2>
        <p>This pilgrim town, 104 kilometres from Mangaluru, is famed for the temple of Kukke Sri Subrahmanya, which is nestled between hills. The epics describe how the celestial serpent Vasuki and other snakes sought sanctuary in the caverns beneath God Subrahmanya. God Subrahmanya is worshipped here as a serpent, which represents the godâ€™s divine strength. During the devotion, a ritual dance known as Nagamandala is performed, in which the dancer assumes the costume of Ardhanarishwara (half man, half woman), symbolising the notion of feminine (prakruthi) and masculine (purusha) powers being one.</p>
